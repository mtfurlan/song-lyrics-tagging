I want to have a script to fix lyrics on all my songs.

Open issues
* Why do some songs have lyrics-xxx *and* lyrics tags?
* Can strawberry read lyrics or does it nead lyrics-xxx/lyrics-eng
* Do I have any non-english lyrics?
* What does strawberry do with multiple lyrics-xxx tags?
* How does flac handle language?
* how does mp3 handle language? I think it's just the first bit of the lyrics field?
