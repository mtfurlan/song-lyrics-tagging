I want to have a script to fix lyrics on all my songs.

Notes on lyrics tag
* lyrics vs lyrics-xxx
  * lyrics are supposed to have a language, xxx means unknown language
  * A lot of tools will just call it lyrics if it's ENG
  * Strawberry will default to eng over xxx
* user-text-frame USLT
  * Some people use this, not sure why: https://docs.puddletag.net/source/id3.html#field-unsyncedlyrics-frame-uslt

Open issues
* How does flac handle language?
* Oops flac is broken cause eyeD3
